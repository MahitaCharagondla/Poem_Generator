# üß†‚ú® Poetry Generation Pipeline with NLP, Web Scraping, Text-to-Image, and Text-to-Audio

This project is an interactive, multi-stage pipeline built in Python using Jupyter Notebook. It combines **web scraping**, **natural language processing (NLP)**, **poem generation**, **image synthesis**, and **text-to-speech audio rendering** to create an immersive multimedia output.

# üìù Poem Generator (Edgar Allan Poe)
This project collects poems by Edgar Allan Poe from [mypoeticside.com](https://mypoeticside.com), cleans the text data, and prepares it for natural language processing tasks such as poem generation.

## üì¶ Dependencies

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy beautifulsoup4 spacy
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Workflow

### 1. **Web Scraping Poems**

**File:** `allan_poems.csv`

- **Goal:** Automatically extract all poems by Edgar Allan Poe from `mypoeticside.com`.
- **Steps:**
  - Send an HTTP request impersonating a browser.
  - Parse the HTML content using BeautifulSoup.
  - Find poem titles and text and save them to a CSV.

**Output:**
A file named `allan_poems.csv` with two columns:
- `title`: Title of the poem
- `text`: Raw poem text

```csv
title,text
"Alone","From childhood's hour I have not been ..."
...
```
---

### 2. **Text Cleaning & Sentence Splitting**

**Function:** `docs_to_sentences('allan_poems.csv')`

- **Goal:** Clean each poem, convert to lowercase, remove unnecessary characters, and split into individual sentences.
- **Techniques Used:**
  - Regular expressions for sentence splitting.
  - Replace unwanted characters (e.g., parentheses, colons).
  - Filter empty strings.

**Output:**
A new file called `sentences_allan_poems.csv` with two columns:
- `doc_id`: Poem number
- `sentence`: One cleaned sentence from the poem

```csv
doc_id,sentence
0,from childhood's hour i have not been
0,as others were i have not seen
...
```

## üß† What You Can Do Next

You can now use the cleaned sentences (`sentences_allan_poems.csv`) to:
- Train a text generation model (e.g., LSTM, GPT, Markov Chains).
- Perform sentiment analysis.
- Analyze literary patterns in Edgar Allan Poe's works.

### 3. **Poem Generation using SpaCy**  
   Leverages linguistic features to structure original poetic stanzas or sentences based on the analysis.

   **Input :** whispers
   **Output :**
   thy heart- thy heart!- i wake and sigh,
     adorn yon world afar, afar-
     'twas such as angel minds above
   that high tone of the spirit which hath striven.

### 4. **Text-to-Image Generation**  
   Uses models from the `diffusers` library (e.g., Stable Diffusion) to visualize the generated poem as an artistic image.

   **Input:** Output of the poem generator
   **Output:** 
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f1b5708-39cd-459b-836e-8dc8925f3033)

### 5. **Text-to-Audio (WAV Format)**  
   Converts the generated poem into speech and saves it as a `.wav` audio file using Microsoft Speecht5-TTS
   **Input:** Output of the poem generator
   **Output:**
